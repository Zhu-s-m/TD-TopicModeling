# TD-TopicModeling

We develop an interactive topic modeling solution. For topic modeling tasks, BERTopic is utilized, while dynamic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) serves as the baseline model. Using this technique, the distribution of themes and topics is obtained by processing high-dimensional vectors using dimensionality reduction and clustering. The system is meant to be a tool that combines the functions of model evaluation and subject modeling. Users may easily browse and find interactive visual charts of subjects and their evolving banking trends using BERTopic. We were able to successfully detect changing themes from customer complaints by using LDA and BERTopic. Specifically, we identified important themes about extension requests, refund concerns, etc. in the federal student loan service data. Furthermore, we assessed the findings using a variety of metrics to determine the document cluster separation, interpretability, diversity, and consistency of the subjects.
